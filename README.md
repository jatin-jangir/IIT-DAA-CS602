# IIT-DAA-CS602


Course Contents: This is the second level course on design and analysis of algorithms.  The aim of this course is to discuss the fundamental topics/concepts from the area of algorithms.  The course will cover the following topics.

1. Divide and Conquer (Advanced applications like polynomial multiplication)
2. Greedy Strategies (Advanced applications like Huffman coding) with emphasis on a generic proof of correctness.
3. Dynamic Programming: Applications like Bellman Ford Algorithms
4. Stable matching
5. Graph algorithms: Shortest paths in graphs (single source, All-pairs, positive as well as negative edge weights), Topological ordering of DAG, DFS in directed graphs, strongly connected components.
6. Network Flows: Ford Fulkerson algorithm, Max-flow Min-cut theorem, polynomial time algorithms for max-flow. A large number of applications will be discussed.
7. Amortized Analysis with applications : Dynamic Tables, Online List Searching with Move-to-Front strategy, Fibonacci Heaps.
8. Notion of intractability: NP-completeness, reduction used to show NP-completeness of some problems.
9. Approximation algorithms
10. Based on availability of time and interest of the class, a few topics from the following list will also be covered.
    1. Bipartite matching algorithm for Hopcroft and Karp
    2. Linear Programming
    3. Pattern matching
    4. Randomized algorithms
